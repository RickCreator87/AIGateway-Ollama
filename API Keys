# API Keys
API keys are used to:
Authenticate requests
Optionally map users to models or behaviors
For development, keys can be defined via environment variables.
Important:
This project is not intended to expose Ollama directly to the public internet without additional security.
---
## Configuration
Environment variables are defined in .env.example.
Typical options include:
Ollama base URL
Default model
API key list or mapping
Gateway port
---
## Error Handling
The gateway attempts to normalize errors into OpenAI-style responses.
Common error cases:
Ollama not running
Model not available
Invalid request payload
Unauthorized API key
